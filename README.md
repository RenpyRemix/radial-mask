# Radial Mask
A Displayable for AlphaMask'ing.  
Pretty straight forward, just set a size, optional center and the start and end degrees

The file starts of with a very basic example using a clockface which you can view by calling the label `radial_mask_example`.  
Please note though that it is not a great example as it uses a timer to tick through the degrees. You'd do better by having a dynamic displayable alter the degree values and return an instance.  
As this is aimed at more experienced programmers, I will leave that to you.




#### Note:  
If the center is positioned on one of the edges, at or near a corner, andgles close to the 90 degree areas might not look the best. They can leave slight gaps between the center and the start of the mask polygon.

### Please note:

The way this approach works might not be suitable for complete beginners. It is just a basic displayable to integrate into other code. As such it will likely require a little knowledge of Ren'Py in order to extend it to your particular needs. 

Though I have tried to explain it as simply as possible, I will not be available to help extend it unless under a paid contract.
Basically, if you want it to do more, you are expected to know enough Ren'Py to handle that yourself (or consider paying someone)
